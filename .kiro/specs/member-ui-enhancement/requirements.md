# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement of the member management functionality in the Bank Mmudzi system. The current system has multiple member UI implementations with inconsistent interfaces and incomplete CRUD operations. This enhancement will create a unified, accessible member management interface with comprehensive CRUD functionality, proper validation, and user-friendly design.

The goal is to provide bank administrators with a complete, intuitive member management system that follows accessibility best practices and provides all necessary operations for managing village banking members.
